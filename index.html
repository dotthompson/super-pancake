    <img src="images/aboutmepic.jpeg" alt="My test image">
    <p>My name is Dorothy. I have two children, ages 7 and 9 and I am a single mother. I have been a homemaker for the past 10 years, but have chosen to broaden myself through learning code in hopes to begin a career. My goal in life is to be intentional, dependable, compassionate, and to always look for the silver linings. I hope to make my children proud, and love them so hard they never forget it. </p>
